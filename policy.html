<h1>Privacy Policy for Logistics Engineer Pro</h1>
<p>Last updated: December 2025</p>

<p>
Logistics Engineer Pro (“the App”) is a mobile application designed for personal
use in logistics operations, warehouse management, and internal productivity.
This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles data.
</p>

<h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
<p>
The App does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information of the user.
All data is stored locally on the user’s device.
</p>

<h2>2. Local Device Storage Only</h2>
<p>
All operational data (documents, items, warehouse locations, inventory results)
is stored only on your device using local storage.
</p>

<h2>3. No Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The App does not use external servers, analytics, cloud storage,
advertising systems, or tracking technologies.
</p>

<h2>4. No Account, Login, or Registration</h2>
<p>
The App does not require any account creation or login.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Control</h2>
<p>
All data inside the App is controlled entirely by the user.  
You may delete the App at any time — all stored data will be permanently removed from the device.
</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App is not intended for children under 13, but it also does not collect any information.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy if required by the App Store or Google Play.
Changes will be reflected on this page.
